# Data Lake

Data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store structured and unstructured data at any scale with low cost. Data lake is a subset of data warehouse, where data comes in, gets cleaned, structured, formatted and packaged for consumption. Data lake can support different types of actions from ETL(Extract, Load, Transform), to analysis, visualization and machine learning.

# HPCC and Data Lake

Data lake is an architecture and methodology fir continuous management of complex data. More enterprises are accepting data lake technology to manage their internal data, solve complex problems, and improve their relationships with customers and suppliers.

In HPCC Systems, data discovery and experimentation is important and with use of data lake, the path from data discovery to production is short and fast.

**HPCC Systems advantages**

- Open source data lake platform
- Batch, real time and streaming data ingestion
- built-in data enhancement and machine learning APIs
- Scalable to many petabyte of data
- Increased responsiveness to customer and stakeholders

## Data Lake Overview

Data lake continuously acquires data from many data sources, both in structured and uninstructed format. Data is usually stored in simple flat files like basic disk files, or in metadata format like Amazon S3.
The process starts with few data sources and some ideas to work on, but these ideas grows over time.
Once data is acquired and ingested the process of data enrichment begins. Data enrichment is an evolving, iterating process to extract as much data possible from data sources. Once the knowledge is extract, it's available to people that need it, which is the start of data delivery phase. During data delivery we make sure that data is transferred in a timely and secure manner.

**Data Curation and Governance**

It is important to have a process for curation; visualization, organizing, and governing the data lake. Data curation is an active and on-going process of data management throughout its life cycle. It is the process of turning independently created data sources into unified data sets ready for user consumption.

Data governance is the process of implementing set of rules and policies to manage and protect data. These policies address issues such as:

- Assigning accountability to employees responsible for data assets
- Granting or restricting per usage and need
- Data privacy and data protection
- Accuracy of data
- Backup plans
- Increasing value of data
- Cost reduction
- Data profiling
- Quality checks
- Addressing SLA (Service Level Agreement)

**Data Swamp**

In contrast with data lake, data swap has little or no curation, including little to no active management throughout the data life cycle. Data swamp contains no or very little data governance or metadata. Metadata can create a tiered storage structure that stops a data lake from turning into a data swamp.

**Data Lake Benefits**

- Enhanced data availability: Promotes continuous value discover.
- Responsive to business needs: Quickly produce production quality data.
- Ease of scaling: Incrementally scale to any capacity.
- Transparency: Visibility into complete process.
- Development efficiency: Removes forced dependencies. The most common reason for project overruns.

# JOIN

## Quick Look

TheÂ join function produces a result set based on the intersection of two datasets or indexes.

```java
attribName := JOIN(LEFT_DatasetName,
                   RIGHT_DatasetName,
				   // fields AND/OR fields that are used to compare datasets
					LEFT.fieldName = RIGHT.fieldName AND
					LEFT.fieldName = RIGHT.fieldName,
					TRANSFORM(Result_RecordLayout,
							SELF := LEFT,
							SELF := RIGHT),
					        JOINType);
```

### Join Types

- INNER: Only those records that exist in both datasets.
- LEFT OUTER: At least one record for every record in the left.
- RIGHT OUTER: At least one record for every record in the right.
- LEFT ONLY: One record for each left record with no match in the left.
- RIGHT ONLY: One record for each left record with no match in the right.
- FULL ONLY: One record for each left and right record with no match in the opposite.

//Inner Join
InnerJoin := JOIN(EmpDS, JobCatDS,
					LEFT.EmpID = RIGHT.EmpID,
					TRANSFORM(EmpResult_Layout,
						SELF := LEFT,
						SELF := RIGHT));

OUTPUT(InnerJoin, NAMED('InnerJoin'));

//LEFT ONLY Join
LeftOnlyJoin := JOIN(EmpDS, JobCatDS,
					LEFT.EmpID = RIGHT.EmpID,
					TRANSFORM(EmpResult_Layout,
							SELF := LEFT,
							SELF := RIGHT),
							LEFT ONLY);

OUTPUT(LeftOnlyJoin, NAMED('LeftOnlyJoin'));

//LEFT OUTER Join
LeftOuterJoin := JOIN(EmpDS, JobCatDS,
						LEFT.EmpID = RIGHT.EmpID,
						TRANSFORM(EmpResult_Layout,
							SELF := LEFT,
							SELF := RIGHT),
							LEFT OUTER);

OUTPUT(LeftOuterJoin, NAMED('LeftOuterJoin'));

# JOIN

## Quick Look

TheÂ join function produces a result set based on the intersection of two datasets or indexes.

- INNER: Only those records that exist in both datasets.
- LEFT OUTER: At least one record for every record in the left.
- RIGHT OUTER: At least one record for every record in the right.
- LEFT ONLY: One record for each left record with no match in the left.
- RIGHT ONLY: One record for each left record with no match in the right.
- FULL ONLY: One record for each left and right record with no match in the opposite.

//Inner Join

OUTPUT(InnerJoin, NAMED('InnerJoin'));

//LEFT ONLY Join
LeftOnlyJoin := JOIN(EmpDS, JobCatDS,

OUTPUT(LeftOnlyJoin, NAMED('LeftOnlyJoin'));

//LEFT OUTER Join
LeftOuterJoin := JOIN(EmpDS, JobCatDS,
